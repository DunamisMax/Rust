It depends on what motivates you most and what new skills you want to explore in Rust. If you’re looking for more CLI practice, here are a few ideas, each covering different aspects of Rust’s ecosystem:

1. **CLI for Fetching API Data (Stocks, Crypto, or News)**
   - **Overview**: Similar to your weather CLI, but targeting a different public API—like a news service or a stock/crypto price feed.
   - **Key Skills**: Learn to manage HTTP requests with [`reqwest`](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest), handle JSON with [`serde`](https://crates.io/crates/serde), configure concurrency (e.g., using [`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) for async fetch calls).

2. **File Organizer CLI**
   - **Overview**: A tool to clean up and organize files in a directory by extension, date, or size. You might have commands like `organize by extension`, `organize by date`, etc.
   - **Key Skills**: Practice file I/O (`std::fs`), error handling, directory traversal, concurrency for large operations (e.g., using threads or async tasks).

3. **Markdown Link Checker**
   - **Overview**: A CLI that scans markdown files (like your `README.md`) and checks all the links to see if they’re valid (returning a 200 status code, for instance).
   - **Key Skills**: Parsing text files, making HTTP HEAD requests with `reqwest`, streaming responses, summarizing results (valid vs. broken links).
   - **Extra Credit**: Add concurrency or caching for repeated checks.

4. **GitHub Release Manager**
   - **Overview**: Automate fetching release notes, creating new releases, or tagging versions for your own projects. Use the GitHub REST API for this.
   - **Key Skills**: Authenticated HTTP requests (with tokens), JSON parsing for GitHub’s data structures, subcommands that either “list releases” or “create release”.

5. **CLI for Local Network Tools**
   - **Overview**: A tool that can do port scanning, ping sweeps, or look up DNS records—like a mini “Swiss Army knife” for networking tasks.
   - **Key Skills**: Low-level network operations with Rust’s standard library or crates like [`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) and [`socket2`](https://crates.io/crates/socket2).
   - **Extra Credit**: Consider concurrency to speed up port scans or pings.

6. **Password Vault or Secure Notes CLI**
   - **Overview**: Store and retrieve passwords or secure notes from an encrypted local file.
   - **Key Skills**: Learn about cryptography in Rust—using crates like [`rust-crypto`](https://crates.io/crates/crypto), [`ring`](https://crates.io/crates/ring), or [`age`](https://crates.io/crates/age) to securely store data. Manage hashed master passwords or passphrases.
   - **Extra Credit**: Explore cross-platform support, such as integration with OS-specific keychains or environment variables.

7. **Music Metadata Organizer**
   - **Overview**: Parse and edit metadata (ID3 tags) in MP3/FLAC/WAV files.
   - **Key Skills**: Use crates like [`id3`](https://crates.io/crates/id3) or [`metaflac`](https://crates.io/crates/metaflac). Practice file iteration and user-friendly commands (`music-cli list-album --album "Thriller"`, `music-cli fix-artwork`).

8. **Interactive Shell or REPL**
   - **Overview**: A custom REPL that might parse user commands to do certain tasks (like evaluating math expressions, or controlling an in-memory to-do list).
   - **Key Skills**: Implement a parser or interpret user input, maintain state across commands. Possibly integrate with [`rustyline`](https://crates.io/crates/rustyline) for a more natural interactive experience (history, autocompletion, etc.).

### Picking Your Project

- **If you want more web/HTTP experience**: A CLI that calls external APIs (idea #1, #3, or #4).
- **If you want to practice file handling & concurrency**: A File Organizer (#2) or a music metadata tool (#7).
- **If security & cryptography fascinate you**: A password vault (#6).
- **If you enjoy tinkering with networking**: A network tool (#5).
- **If you want to build something fully interactive**: A REPL-like CLI (#8).

Each idea will push you to deepen your Rust knowledge and make something practical. Pick what resonates with you most, and have fun coding!
